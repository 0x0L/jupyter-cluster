* cluster management tool: deployment nodes, stop/kill/rm

* have a look at ssh engine launcher (custom ssh command)

* how to set up config files so that one can use Client(profile='ssh') ?

* supervisor with python3 from master ?

* more scipy packages, check optional dependencies

* folder -> tarfile ==> simpler injection in docker, no need to mount anything
  Alternatively mount only the files

* error handling, restarting, have a look at supervisord
